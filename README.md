# ID Product Feedback & Requests
This repository is lovingly modeled after [GitHub's feedback repository](https://github.com/github/feedback).

In this repository, you can find the [official Interactive Design product feedback discussions](https://github.com/bu-ist/id-product-feedback/discussions) for the following product areas, as well as an overall category for general product feedback:

**Please note:** GitHub discussions is currently limited to 9 categories. The final category is dedicated to announcements.

These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the GitHub product team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

This repository works in conjunction with our product team meeting, which is a dedicated time where we review your feedback from this repository, our ongoing project priorities, and any new changes. In the near future, we expect to have the dedicated resources to be able to begin providing a true roadmap, where you can find out what work is planned and when you can expect it will be delivered to you. Accordingly, the Issues feature of this repository has been disabled. Discussion categories have been established for specific features listed above, as well as a general category for other topics. Additional categories may be added in the future. In the meantime, topics outside of the listed categories above, will be transferred into the general category. Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/bu-ist/id-product-feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out [how to give good feedback](https://github.com/bu-ist/id-product-feedback/discussions/1) if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion, the Interactive Design product team will evaluate the feedback, but will not be able to respond to every submission. From there, we will work with you, and the entire community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities our product doesn‚Äôt have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

- If the product team determines that we are going to prioritize a feature to solve the problem you've identified, we may open an issue and add it to our list of items for future development. When a true roadmap is available, you will be able to see it on that roadmap, and we will comment back on the discussion letting you know that your idea has been accepted and where you can follow its development status.
- If the product team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified, we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
